/// @file
/// @brief Characterization tests for `NDTScanMatcher`.
///
/// These tests exist to make a refactor provable, not to specify desirable behavior. They pin
/// what the node does *today*, through its ROS surface (`/diagnostics`, output topics, services),
/// so that extracting the decision logic into a ROS-free core can be shown to preserve it.
///
/// Rules that keep them trustworthy:
///
///  - **Assert current behavior, even when it looks wrong.** Cases marked `SUSPICIOUS` pin
///    behavior that reads like a bug. They are deliberately frozen; changing them is a separate,
///    explicit decision, not a side effect of a refactor.
///  - **Never assert NDT numerics.** Alignment runs under OpenMP and the initial-pose search
///    draws from a process-global RNG, so pose/score values are not reproducible. Assert
///    decisions, key sets, levels and message text instead.
///  - **Override every parameter an assertion depends on**, even when it already matches the
///    shipped yaml, so a config change cannot silently flip a test.
///  - **Prefer `absent(key)` to witness ordering.** The diagnostics key set is the only evidence
///    of which gate short-circuited which.
///
/// One binary, one node per test: each test builds its own `NdtHarness`, whose destructor tears
/// the node down in a specific order. Tests never call `rclcpp::shutdown()`.
///
/// **Run this through ctest, not by invoking the binary.** `ament_add_ros_isolated_gtest` hands the
/// target an unused `ROS_DOMAIN_ID`; run directly, it lands on the default domain and shares topic
/// and service names with anything else there. Two concurrent instances are enough: the
/// `count() == 1` assertions see the other instance's publications, and its
/// `/ekf_pose_with_covariance` and `/trigger_node_srv` traffic drives this instance's node, so
/// interpolation and map state come out wrong. Measured across two- and four-way runs, anywhere
/// from a few to sixteen assertions fail per process, varying widely between runs — and every one
/// of them reads like a defect in the node. A node built from patched sources on the same domain
/// can break the absence assertions too, so a mutation experiment running next door is enough —
/// though only some runs get that far, because the level assertion ahead of them aborts the body
/// first. Debugging a single case directly is fine; set `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` yourself first.
///
/// `skipping_publish_num` counts per node, so a case that leaves it advanced cannot hand the next
/// one a value it does not expect. It was a function-local `static` shared across the whole binary
/// when these cases were written, which is why several of them used to reset it on the way out.
